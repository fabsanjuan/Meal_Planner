The app is intended to provide users with a web solution to create meal plans and meet dietary needs. 
It is intended for users with busy schedules to quickly create meal plans, set nutritional goals and setup mobile alerts and reminders.
It allows users to select from preset recipes and schedule them on a calendar. The app will monitor the nutrional contents of the meals and
users can verify whether or not they ate meals. Lastly, the app will keep track of ingredients' inventory and generate grocery lists or alerts accordingly.

I am in the process of updating my project files / local files / project outline onto the main branch of this repository. New updates to this repository will be updated periodically in the next weeks. I'm using VS code and git to practice proper VCS processes and learn more along the way. The original files were simply uploaded to the main repository - no VCS.
